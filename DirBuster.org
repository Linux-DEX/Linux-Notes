* Introduction
+ DirBuster is a tool used for brute-forcing directories and files on web servers. 
+ It is designed to discover hidden or non-indexed directories and files by systematically trying different combinations of directory and file names.
+ DirBuster works by sending HTTP requests to the target web server with various directory and file names, checking for valid responses.
+ It comes with a built-in wordlist containing common directory and file names, but it also allows users to specify custom wordlists.
